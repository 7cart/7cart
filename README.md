#### Try it!
 * [Installation][4]
 * [Documentation][5]

#### Why 7cart?
7cart is for building projects that can't be built with the existing e-commerce platforms. It aims to be free of:
* difficult to support code and database
* slow requests

#### How is 7cart better?
The project database doesn't implement [EAV][1] table,
but the Entity table with [JSONB][8] columns.
That gives:
* less relations and simple code
* simpler and faster SQL queries [[proof link][2]]

#### Features
* built in Docker,
it can be quickly deployed and run on different OSs;
* built-in Product Filters and Filer Counters

#### Technology stack
Built as a Single Page Application (SPA),
it utilises the latest possible
* Ember.js
* Symfony 4
* PostgreSQL
* PHP 7
